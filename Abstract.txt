1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================
HealthChat Assist is a modern, Single Page Application (SPA) developed to act 
as an intelligent, first-line digital health assistant. 

It leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) to analyze user-reported 
symptoms and provide structured, preliminary health guidance. The goal is to 
democratize access to basic health information, offering users immediate 
insights into possible conditions, over-the-counter medications, and safe 
home-care tips.


2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
================================================================================
The project utilizes a cutting-edge, type-safe web stack optimized for 
performance and maintainability.

  [ Frontend Framework ]
  - React 19: Uses the latest React features for a responsive, component-based 
    architecture.

  [ Language ]
  - TypeScript: Ensures code reliability, strict typing, and easier refactoring.

  [ Styling & UI ]
  - Tailwind CSS: Implements a utility-first styling approach.
  - Theme: Custom "Medical Teal" (HSL-based) for a professional, calming aesthetic.

  [ Artificial Intelligence ]
  - Google Gemini API (@google/genai): The core intelligence engine.
  - Model: gemini-2.5-flash.
  - Configuration: set with a low temperature (0.1) and strict JSON schema 
    to ensure factual, structured output acting as a "Clinical Pharmacist."

  [ Navigation ]
  - React Router DOM: Handles smooth client-side routing between pages.


3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & WORKFLOW
================================================================================
The application operates on a linear, event-driven workflow designed to mimic 
a professional medical consultation.

  Step A: Symptom Intake
  ----------------------
  The user enters symptoms in natural language. The interface then dynamically 
  reveals a "Pain Radius Bar," allowing the user to visually select intensity 
  (Low, Normal, High). This multi-step input ensures the AI has adequate context.

  Step B: AI Processing
  ---------------------
  The frontend constructs a prompt combining the symptom text and pain level. 
  This is sent to the Gemini API with a system instruction that:
    1. Enforces a specific JSON output structure.
    2. Validates that suggested medications are real, commercially available 
       OTC products (Brand/Generic).
    3. Filters out prescription-only advice, replacing it with a referral 
       to see a doctor.

  Step C: Response Rendering
  --------------------------
  The AI's response is parsed and displayed in a staggered, conversational 
  sequence to reduce cognitive load:
    1. "Possible Conditions"
    2. "Suggested Medications" (with disclaimers)
    3. "Precautionary Tips"


4. KEY FEATURES & ADVANTAGES
================================================================================
  
  + Structured Intelligence
    Unlike standard chatbots that return blocks of text, HealthChat Assist 
    categorizes data into strict UI elements (lists, bullet points), making 
    information easy to digest.

  + Real-World Medication Data
    The AI is prompt-engineered to function as a pharmacist, ensuring it suggests 
    actual brand names (e.g., "Advil", "Tylenol") rather than generic chemical 
    compounds only, improving usability for the layperson.

  + Safety First
    Strict guardrails prevent the AI from making definitive diagnoses or 
    suggesting prescription drugs, adhering to responsible AI practices in healthcare.

  + Interactive UX
    The application features a polished UI with animations, a visual pain scale, 
    and instant feedback mechanisms.


5. DISCLAIMER
================================================================================
This application is a demonstration of AI capabilities in the health domain. 
It is NOT a replacement for professional medical advice. Users are explicitly 
warned to consult healthcare professionals for diagnoses and treatments.
